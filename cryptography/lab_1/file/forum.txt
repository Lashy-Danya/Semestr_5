Again, opening existing files in 'w' mode is not a good idea, you'll lose the content of your file. –

I'm not sure if that's what OP wants to do exactly (the question is not super clear), but 'a' mode is safer than 'w' because at least you won't lose the existing contents. –

@Drew Nolan, be careful about the file name in the sample code, it should be changed accordingly.... to pass.txt –
